# Plan: Repository Work Plan

This plan is the source of truth for work tracking.

Rules:
- Every checkbox line MUST include tags for labels, status, priority, estimate, start/end dates.
- Subtasks are indented by 2 spaces under their parent.
- Prefer short, action-oriented titles and include a brief description.
